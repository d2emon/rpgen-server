$description : This is my personal go-to clothing generator that randomly generates a variety of articles of clothing.  If you’ve stumbled upon this, you’ll probably not understand what the traits mean unless you’ve done as extensive note-taking as I have, and even then it might still be confusing, but if you can understand it, then go right ahead and use this as much as you would like.  This is just to get me started, and I can change whatever doesn't make sense (including clothing items that doesn't match the character's gender or personality).
